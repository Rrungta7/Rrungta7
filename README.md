👋 Hi, I’m Riddhi Rungta

🎯 Passionate about data that drives action — from dashboards to algorithms, I’m all about turning raw numbers into real stories.

🔍 Exploring everything data:
- Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling
- Interactive Dashboards & BI Tools
- Data Storytelling, Automation & ETL
- Forecasting, Clustering, Optimization

🛠️ Currently playing with:
`Python` | `SQL` | `Power BI` | `Tableau` | `Google Data Studio`  
`Streamlit` | `Excel/VBA` | `AWS/GCP` | `Scikit-learn` | `Pandas` | `Seaborn` | `ARIMA`

💡 I build:
- 📊 Dashboards that executives actually *use*
- 🧠 Machine learning models with purpose
- 📈 Visuals that simplify the complex
- 🤖 Automations that save time (and sanity)

🌱 Constantly learning and always curious — currently working on personal tech + finance dashboards, student engagement analytics, and some very cool side experiments.

🎨 Fun fact: I see datasets the way artists see blank canvases — full of potential.

✨ Thanks for stopping by!
